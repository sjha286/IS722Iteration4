# IS722Iteration4
This repository contains the datasets and Jupyter notebook scripts used for Iteration 4(BDAS) of Infosys 722. Link to the complete dataset is provided in the report.<br/>
The csv files uploaded here are for Step 2.<br/>
Here are the links to the main datasets(Step 3 onwards) as they are too large for Github. They have to be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the codes to run.<br/>

After re-iteration 1, the dataset was changed, and 23-00089_UOF-P.csv was used, which is included here. It has to be renamed in order to execute the steps of the reiteration.
