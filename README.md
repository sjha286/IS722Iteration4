# IS722Iteration4
This repository contains the datasets and Jupyter notebook scripts used for Iteration 4(BDAS) of Infosys 722. Link to the complete dataset is provided in the report.<br/>
The csv files uploaded here are for Step 2.<br/>
Here are the links to the main datasets as they are too large for Github. They have to be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the codes(Steps 3,4.ipynb) to run.<br/>
  Police interview file for Department 11: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfcbmvOw0a_ZKuGTo4F8XdBO268HRoHQ/view?usp=sharing<br/>
  Vehicle Stops file for Department 24: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zuaJYBCxk_2SCnprk7vfOjpRWm1AEAXe/view?usp=sharing<br/>
After re-iteration 1, the dataset was changed, and 37-00049_UOF-P_2016_prepped.csv was used, which is included here.
Re-iteration 1.ipynb contains all the steps of the re-iteration, and Department 37 prepped.csv is the result. This is used in Re1 4.2ipynb to create a feature-label vector stored in Department 37 vector.csv, which is used for the actual data mining.
