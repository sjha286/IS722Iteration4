# IS722Iteration4
This repository contains the datasets and Jupyter notebook scripts used for Iteration 4(BDAS) of Infosys 722. Link to the complete dataset is provided in the report.<br/>
The csv files uploaded here are for Step 2.<br/>
Here are the links to the main datasets(Step 3 onwards) as they are too large for Github. They have to be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the codes to run.<br/>
  Police interview file for Department 11: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfcbmvOw0a_ZKuGTo4F8XdBO268HRoHQ/view?usp=sharing<br/>
  Vehicle Stops file for Department 24: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zuaJYBCxk_2SCnprk7vfOjpRWm1AEAXe/view?usp=sharing<br/>
The datasets obtained after Step 3 have been uploaded as "Police Interviews after Step 3" and "Vehicle Stops after Step 3". This is because PySpark creates new csv files within separate folders with alphanumeric names, so they have been renamed and can be placed in the same folder as the codes.
